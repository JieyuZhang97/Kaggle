# Kaggle
All my kaggle competitions 
- **Titanic passenger survival prediction**: This notebook is for my first kaggle competition - predicting the survived passengers on the Titanic. After practicing, my prediction gives 78% accuracy. Though through my course of refining my codes, the performance of the prediction did not improve at all (my first simple prediction from 5 lines of codes also gave me 78% accuracy), I did learn many different ways of dealing with missing values, feature engineering and data visualization.
