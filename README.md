# Kaggle
All my kaggle competitions 
- **Titanic passenger survival prediction**: This notebook is for my first kaggle competition - *predicting the survived passengers on the Titanic*. After practicing, my prediction gives 78% accuracy. Though through my course of refining my codes, the performance of the prediction did not improve at all (my first simple prediction from 5 lines of codes also gave me 78% accuracy), I did learn many different ways of dealing with missing values, feature engineering and data visualization.

- **House price prediction**: This notebook analyzes the data set from the competition - *House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques*. My prediction gives a root mean squared error (RSME) of 0.11, making the submission top 4%. In this competition, I learned extensively on how to deal with a large amount of features (79). I found looking at the data description file is very useful. I practiced feature engineering and explored various regression algorithms that are robust to outliers.
